/**
 * Head Code: Flicker Prevention Script (also requires CSS)
 * ------------------------------------
 * After the DOM is ready, this script sets the html elementâ€™s opacity and visibility
 * back to visible with a tiny delay to ensure the page renders smoothly without flicker.
 * 
 * It also removes the `.wf-loading` class from the <html> element once the page is ready.
 * This is important because Webflow adds this class during page load to help control visibility.
